#### Project team structures

Project teams working on research software may have different sizes and structures,
and different approaches to how they undertake their work. Within a project,
there may be only a single RSE undertaking software development,
based either locally or within an RSE team.
For individual developers based locally in research groups/teams, they may be
classed as a researcher, even if the bulk of their work is software development.
Alternatively, in a larger project, a group of RSEs might be involved - these RSEs
could be based locally within a research group or team and the individuals may
be classed as researchers, or they could be a group of RSEs from a departmental
or central RSE team. In the context of an RSE team, RSEs may be working on multiple
projects which can change the way that they plan and work on development tasks
and the tools and approaches that they use.

In this table, we look at individual or team competencies and approaches to them,
considering how these differ depending on whether an RSE or researcher is working alone on a software project,
or whether they are working as part of a team of research software developers.
We extend this to consider how things differ when a developer or a group
of developers is based locally within a research team or department,
or when they are based in a dedicated RSE team.
We also look at organizational aspects in the context of each of the considered
competencies since there are a variety of ways that organizations can contribute
to and support them. We first summarise the meaning of each of the columns in the table:

- **Competency:** The code assigned to the competency being considered.
  See the list in **[Table ?????]**.
- **Individual developer (Locally-based):** A single person working on some
  research software - often a researcher with RSE skills.
- **Individual developer (RSE team-based):** A single person working on research
  software - generally a professional RSE supporting another team's software single-handedly.
- **Group of developers (Locally-based):** A group of RSEs/researchers within
  a research group or team, working together on developing software to support
  or undertake a single research goal/project.
- **Group of developers (RSE team-based):** A group of members of the RSE team
  working together on a research software project for a research group.
- **Organization-level support:** How the defined competencies are recognised
  and represented at organisational level.

          within the group? Who can they ask?</td>

          Can also often provide advice to projects themselves or
          provide links with other parties who can help.</td>

          individually on a project, to explore new tools and approaches,
          make relevant contacts and learn more about the project domain.</td>

          team members with strong awareness of the research lifecycle.</td>

          to support this or can access assistance via team colleagues.</td>
      <td>If a team of embedded researchers/developers are involved in a larger
          project, there's more chance that there's a case for external use.
          Do they have the skills and resources to support this?</td>
      <td>A team of RSEs can generally better prepare code for external users
          (e.g. by applying development best practices) and provide infrastructure

In the table above, we've looked at how different competencies can be related
to and handled by researchers and RSEs working in different environments within
an organisation and how the organisations themselves can contribute.
We recognise that this is a challenging area to gain a detailed view of
and that our content in the table is still a significant generalisation.
We talk about the "Research Software Engineer" as a single entity but as the field expands,
we expect to see more roles and job titles emerging around the RSE concept,
many of which fit under the wider umbrella of Research Technology Professionals (RTPs).
The European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI)'s BioExcel competency framework
[**[BIOEXCEL-FRAMEWORK]**](https://competency.ebi.ac.uk/framework/bioexcel/3.0/carreer-profiles)
provides some examples of different RSE-like computational roles.
Work by King's Digital Lab at King's College London also provides
some examples of a range of different roles within the research software
careers space [**[KDL-CAREERS](https://zenodo.org/record/2559235)**].
